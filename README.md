# Portfolio-Risk-Analysis-and-Stress-Testing-
This project provides a comprehensive Python-based framework for portfolio risk analysis, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. It leverages real market data fetched via the yfinance library to simulate portfolio performance under various market conditions and evaluate key risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).

Features
Portfolio Data Integration: Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Risk Metrics Calculation: Compute portfolio-level VaR and CVaR to quantify downside risk.
Stress Testing: Simulate extreme market conditions to assess portfolio resilience.
Sensitivity Analysis: Evaluate the impact of interest rate changes, equity index movements, and sector performance on portfolio returns.
Visualization: Generate intuitive plots to visualize portfolio risks and stress test results.
